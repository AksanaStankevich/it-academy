            <p>Chess is believed to have originated in northwest India, by about the early 7th century. Its early form
                was known as chaturaṅga – infantry, cavalry, elephants, and chariotry, represented by the pieces that
                would evolve into the modern pawn, knight, bishop, and rook, respectively. Chaturanga was played on an
                8×8 uncheckered board, called ashtāpada.Thence it spread eastward and westward along the Silk Road. The
                earliest evidence of chess is found in the nearby Sasanian Persia around 600, where the game came to be
                known by the name chatrang. Chatrang was taken up by the Muslim world after the Islamic conquest of
                Persia (633–44), where it was then named shatranj, with the pieces largely retaining their Persian
                names. In Spanish shatranj was rendered as ajedrez (al-shatran), in Portuguese as xadrez, and in Greek
                as ζατρίκιον (zatrikion, which comes directly from the Persian chatrang), but in the rest of Europe it
                was replaced by versions of the Persian shāh (king), which was familiar as an exclamation and became the
                English words check and chess. The word checkmate is derived from the Persian shāh māt (the king is
                helpless). The oldest archaeological chess artifacts, ivory pieces, were excavated in ancient Afrasiab,
                today's Samarkand, in Uzbekistan, Central Asia, and date to about 760, with some of them possibly older.
                The oldest known chess manual was in Arabic and dates to 840–850, written by al-Adli ar-Rumi (800–870),
                a renowned Arab chess player, titled Kitab ash-shatranj (Book of the chess). This is a lost manuscript,
                but referenced in later works. The eastern migration of chess, into China and Southeast Asia, has even
                less documentation than its migration west. (Record of the Mysterious and Strange), dating to about 800.
                Alternatively, some contend that chess arose from Chinese chess or one of its predecessors, although
                this has been contested. The game reached Western Europe and Russia by at least three routes, the
                earliest being in the 9th century. By the year 1000, it had spread throughout both Muslim Iberia and
                Latin Europe. A Latin poem de scachis dated to the late 10th century has been preserved in Einsiedeln
                Abbey. A famous 13th-century manuscript covering chess, backgammon, and dice is known as the Libro de
                los juegos.

            <p>Around 1200, the rules of shatranj started to be modified in southern Europe, and around 1475, several
                major changes made the game essentially as it is known today. These modern rules for the basic moves had
                been adopted in Italy and Spain. Pawns gained the option of advancing two squares on their first move,
                while bishops and queens acquired their modern abilities. The queen replaced the earlier vizier chess
                piece towards the end of the 10th century and by the 15th century had become the most powerful piece;
                consequently, modern chess was referred to as Queen's Chess or Mad Queen Chess. Castling, derived from
                the kings leap usually in combination with a pawn or rook move to bring the king to safety, was
                introduced. These new rules quickly spread throughout western Europe. Writings about chess theory began
                to appear in the 15th century. The Repetición de Amores y Arte de Ajedrez by Spanish churchman Luis
                Ramírez de Lucena was published in Salamanca in 1497. Lucena and later masters like Portuguese Pedro
                Damiano, Italians Giovanni Leonardo Di Bona, Giulio Cesare Polerio and Gioachino Greco, and Spanish
                bishop Ruy López de Segura developed elements of openings and started to analyze simple endgames.</p>

            <p>In the 18th century, the center of European chess life moved from the Southern European countries to
                France. The two most important French masters were François-André Danican Philidor, a musician by
                profession, who discovered the importance of pawns for chess strategy, and later Louis-Charles Mahé de
                La Bourdonnais, who activity in this period were coffee houses in major European cities like Café de la
                Régence in Paris and Simpson's 19th century, the convention that White moves first was established
                (formerly either White or Black could move first). Finally, the rules around castling were standardized
                – variations in the castling rules had persisted in Italy until the late 19th century. The resulting
                standard game is sometimes referred to as Western chess or international chess, particularly in Asia
                where other games of the chess family such as xiangqi are prevalent. Since the 19th century, the only
                rule changes have been technical in nature, for example establishing the correct procedure for claiming
                a draw by repetition. As the 19th century progressed, chess organization developed quickly. Many chess
                clubs, chess books, and chess journals appeared. There were correspondence matches between cities; for
                example, the London Chess Club played against the Edinburgh Chess Club in 1824.Chess problems became a
                regular part of 19th-century newspapers; Bernhard Horwitz, Josef Kling, and Samuel Loyd composed some of
                the most influential problems. In 1843, von der Lasa published his and Bilguer's Handbuch des
                Schachspiels (Handbook of Chess), the first comprehensive manual of chess theory.
            </p>
            <p>The first modern chess tournament was organized by Howard Staunton, a leading English chess player, and
                was held in London in 1851. It was won by the German Adolf Anderssen, who was hailed as the leading
                chess master. His brilliant, energetic attacking style was typical for the time.Sparkling games like
                Anderssen's Immortal Game and Evergreen Game or Morphy's "Opera Game" were regarded as the highest
                possible summit of the chess art. Deeper insight into the nature of chess came with the American Paul
                Morphy, an extraordinary chess prodigy. Morphy won against all important competitors (except Staunton,
                who refused to play), including Anderssen, during his short chess career between 1857 and 1863. Morphy's
                success stemmed from a combination of brilliant attacks and sound strategy; he intuitively knew how to
                prepare attacks.

            <p>Prague-born Wilhelm Steinitz laid foundations for the scientific approach to the game, the art to break a
                position down into its components and prepare correct plans. In addition to his theoretical
                achievements, Steinitz founded an important tradition: his triumph over the leading German master
                Johannes Zukertort in 1886 is regarded as the first official World Chess Championship. Steinitz lost his
                crown in 1894 to a much younger player, the German mathematician Emanuel Lasker, who maintained this
                title for 27 years, the longest tenure of any world champion. After the end of the 19th century, the
                number of master tournaments and matches held annually quickly grew. The first Olympiad was held in
                Paris in 1924, and <abbr title="фр. Federation Internationale des Echecs">FIDE</abbr> was founded
                initially for the purpose of organizing that event. In 1927, the Women's World Chess Championship was
                established; the first to hold the title was Czech-English master Vera Menchik. A prodigy from Cuba,
                José Raúl Capablanca, known for his skill in endgames, won the World Championship from Lasker in 1921.
                Capablanca was undefeated in tournament play for eight years, from 1916 to 1924. His successor (1927)
                was the Russian-French Alexander Alekhine, a strong attacking player who died as the world champion in
                1946. Alekhine briefly lost the title to Dutch player Max Euwe in 1935 and regained it two years later.
                Between the world wars, chess was revolutionized by the new theoretical school of so-called
                hypermodernists like Aron Nimzowitsch and Richard Réti. They advocated to occupy the center with pawns,
                which become objects of attack.

            <p>After the death of Alekhine, a new World Champion was sought. <abbr
                    title="фр. Federation Internationale des Echecs">FIDE</abbr>, which has controlled the title since
                then (except for one interruption), ran a tournament of elite players. The winner of the 1948 tournament
                was Russian Mikhail Botvinnik. In 1950 <abbr
                    title="фр. Federation Internationale des Echecs">FIDE</abbr> established a system of titles,
                conferring the titles of Grandmaster and International Master on 27 players. (Some sources state that in
                1914 the title of chess Grandmaster was first formally conferred by Tsar Nicholas II of Russia to
                Lasker, Capablanca, Alekhine, Tarrasch, and Marshall, but this is a disputed claim.Mikhail Botvinnik,
                the first post-war World Champion Botvinnik started an era of Soviet dominance in the chess world. Until
                the end of the Soviet Union, there was only one non-Soviet champion, American Bobby Fischer (champion
                1972–1975). Botvinnik revolutionized opening theory. Previously Black strove for equality, to neutralize
                White's first-move advantage. As Black, Botvinnik strove for the initiative from the beginning. In the
                previous informal system of World Championships, the current champion decided which challenger he would
                play for the title and the challenger was forced to seek sponsors for the match. <abbr
                    title="фр. Federation Internationale des Echecs">FIDE</abbr> set up a new system of qualifying
                tournaments and matches. The world's strongest players were seeded into Interzonal tournaments, where
                they were joined by players who had qualified from Zonal tournaments. The leading finishers in these
                Interzonals would go on the "Candidates" stage, which was initially a tournament, and later a series of
                knockout matches. The winner of the Candidates would then play the reigning champion for the title. A
                champion defeated in a match had a right to play a rematch a year later. This system operated on a
                three-yearcycle. Botvinnik participated in championship matches over a period of fifteen years. He won
                the world championship tournament in 1948 and retained the title in tied matches in 1951 and 1954. In
                1957, he lost to Vasily Smyslov, but regained the title in a rematch in 1958. In 1960, he lost the title
                to the 23-year-old Latvian prodigy Mikhail Tal, an accomplished tactician and attacking player.
                Botvinnik again regained the title in a rematch in 1961. Following the 1961 event, <abbr
                    title="фр. Federation Internationale des Echecs">FIDE</abbr> abolished the automatic right of a
                deposed champion to a rematch, and the next champion, Armenian Tigran Petrosian, a player renowned for
                his defensive and positional skills, held the title for two cycles, 1963–1969. His successor, Boris
                Spassky from Russia (champion 1969–1972), won games in both positional and sharp tactical style. The
                next championship, the so-called Match of the Century, saw the first non-Soviet challenger since World
                War II, American Bobby Fischer. Fischer defeated his opponents in the Candidates matches by unheard-of
                margins, and convincingly defeated Spassky for the world championship. The match was followed closely by
                news media of the day, leading to a surge in popularity for chess. In 1975, however, Fischer refused to
                defend his title against Soviet Anatoly Karpov when <abbr
                    title="фр. Federation Internationale des Echecs">FIDE</abbr> did not meet his demands, and Karpov
                obtained the title by default. Fischer modernized many aspects of chess, especially by extensively
                preparing openings.
            </p>
            <p>Karpov defended his title twice against Viktor Korchnoi and dominated the 1970s and early 1980s with a
                string of tournament successes.Karpov's reign finally ended in 1985 at the hands of Garry Kasparov,
                another Soviet player from Baku, Azerbaijan. Kasparov and Karpov contested five world title matches
                between 1984 and 1990; Karpov never won his title back. In 1993, Garry Kasparov and Nigel Short broke
                with <abbr title="фр. Federation Internationale des Echecs">FIDE</abbr> to organize their own match for
                the title and formed a competing <abbr title="Professional Chess Association">PCA</abbr>. From then
                until 2006, there were two simultaneous World Champions and World Championships: the PCA or Classical
                champion extending the Steinitzian tradition in which the current champion plays a challenger in a
                series of many games, and he other following <abbr
                    title="фр. Federation Internationale des Echecs">FIDE's</abbr> new format of many players competing
                in a tournament to determine the champion. Kasparov lost his Classical title
                in 2000 to Vladimir Kramnik of Russia. The World Chess Championship 2006, in which Kramnik beat the
                <abbr title="фр. Federation Internationale des Echecs">FIDE</abbr> World Champion Veselin Topalov,
                reunified the titles and made Kramnik the undisputed World Chess Champion In September 2007, he lost the
                title to Viswanathan Anand of India, who won the championship tournament in Mexico City. Anand defended
                his title n the revenge match of 2008, 2010 and 2012. In 2013, Magnus Carlsen of Norway beat Anand in
                the 2013 World Chess Championship. He defended his title the following year, again against Anand.
                Carlsen confirmed his title in 2016 against the Russian Sergey Karjakin and in 2018 against the American
                Fabiano Caruana, in both occasions by a rapid tiebreaker match after equality in 12 games of classical
                time control, and isthe reigning world champion.
