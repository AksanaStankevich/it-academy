                <p> The brain is divided into two parts, the left side which helps with things related to logic and
                    mathematics, etc. while the right part is imbued with creativity. Chess is a competitive game
                    where you need both logic and logical thinking and creativity. When you play chess, you are using
                    all the parts of your brain to think of your next move, your opponent’s next move, a creative and
                    unexpected way to block them and etc. Chess also tests your sight and hearing since you make a
                    decision after seeing and understanding the move your opponent makes. Chess shows that success
                    rewards hard work. The more you practice, the better you'll become. You should be ready to lose and
                    learn from your mistakes. One of the greatest players ever, Capablanca said:
                <blockquote>"You may learn much more from a game you lose than from a game you win. You will have to
                    lose hundreds of games before becoming a good player".</blockquote>

                <p>Concentration to key to success in chess just as Robert James Fischer (Bobby Fischer), a chess
                    grandmaster from America, quoted “Chess demands total concentration.” To win and outmaneuver your
                    opponent, you need to stay focused and quickly and swiftly make judgments based on what is happening
                    on the board. If you lose focus for even a minute, your opponent can outsmart you and emerge
                    victoriously. Chess players can make focus wavers for even an instant, he/she will probably lose due
                    to a small blunder or mistake. This depth of concentration can also help you in other sectors of
                    life like schoolwork, lectures, and deadlines for projects. By totally focusing on the tasks at
                    hand, you will be able to do it to the best of your capabilities and it will turn out error-free and
                    good.</p>

                    and become the victor. Chess develops logical thinking. Chess requires some understanding of logical
                    strategy. For example, you will know that it is important to bring your pieces out into the game at
                    the beginning, to keep your king safe at all times, not to make big weaknesses in your position and
                    not to blunder your pieces away for free. Although you will find yourself doing that occasionally
                    through your chess career. Mistakes are inevitable and chess, like life, is a never-ending learning
                    process. Chess promotes imagination and creativity.</p>

                    constructed. Chess teaches independence. You are forced to make important decisions influenced
                    only by your own judgment. Chess develops the capability to predict and foresee consequences of
                    actions. It teaches you to look both ways before crossing the street. Chess inspires
                    self-motivation. It encourages the search of the best move, the best plan, and the most beautiful
                    continuation out of the endless possibilities. It encourages the everlasting aim towards progress,
                    always steering to ignite the flame of victory.

                </figure>
                <p>Chess makes you use your brain and also memory since you need to remember the chess rules,
                    techniques, and your opponent’s playing style if you have played with him/her before. You also need
                    to imprint the techniques that have allowed you to win before or helped you to get out of a
                    tricky situation. Slowly and gradually as you continue to play and gain experience, your reaction
                    time to an attack decreases and you can make instant decisions on how to counterattack.</p>
                <p>A strong memory will not only help you in chess but also in other fields in life such as in work,
                    you will always remember the deadlines and in your personal life, you won’t easily forget a promise
                    or a commitment. If you’re a student, you will be able to memorize text quickly and your grades will
                    go up by playing chess or fun. In the long run, it will also reduce the chances of you developing
                    Alzheimer’s disease in your old age since it is related to memory loss.</p>
                <p>At the 40th World Chess Congress in 1969, Dr. Hans Klaus, Dean of the School of Philosophy at
                    Humboldt University in Berlin, commented upon the chess studies completed in Germany:
                <blockquote>Chess helps any human being to elaborate exact methods of thinking. It would be
                    particularly useful to start playing chess from the early school days.Everybody prefers to learn
                    something while playing rather than to learn it formally… it produces in our children an improvement
                    in their school achievements. Those children who received systematic instructions in chess improved
                    their school efficiency in different subjects, in contrast with those who did not receive that kind
                    of instruction.
                </blockquote>
                </p>
                <p>Chess is a game for people of all ages. You can learn to play at any age and in chess, unlike in many
                    other sports, you don't ever have to retire. Age is also not a factor when you're looking for an
                    opponent - young can play old and old can play young. Chess develops memory. The chess theory is
                    complicated and many players memorize different opening variations. You will also learn to recognize
                    various patterns and remember lengthy variations.</p>

                </figure>
                <p>Chess requires its players to have foresight, planning skills, and strategic thinking and the skill
                    that backs up all of these other skills is analytical thinking. To first make a move or solve a
                    problem, you need to observe the move your opponent makes or understand what the problem is. Only
                    after you have looked at the problem from all parameters – no problem has only one angle -, you will
                    be able to come up with a solution to outsmart the enemy.</p>
                <p>Analytical thinking is the first part of the equation and making a strategy to counterattack is the
                    second part. Trying to make a strategy and facing hurdles helps to develop and strengthen strategic
                    thinking. Chess is a game where only one plan of action is sure to get you slaughtered so you need
                    backup plans – the more the better. When playing chess, you need to quickly analyze and come up with
                    various plans to counter the steps your opponent has just taken. You will automatically attain
                    foresight after you have tried, achieved with a strategy, or failed but it depends heavily on your
                    memory too.</p>
                <p>Chess opens up the world for you. You don't need to be a high ranked player to enter big
                    important competitions. Even tournaments such as the US Open and the World Open welcome players of
                    all strengths. Chess provides you with plenty of opportunities to travel not only all around the
                    country but also around the world. Chess is a universal language and you can communicate with anyone
                    over the checkered plain. Chess enables you to meet many interesting people. You will make life-long
                    friendships withpeople you meet through chess. Chess is cheap. You don't need big fancy equipment to
                    play chess. In fact, all you may need is your computer! It is also good to have a chess set at home
                    to practice with family members, to take to a friend's house or even to your local neighborhood park
                    to get everyone interested in the game. Chess is fun! Dude, this isn't just another one of those
                    board games. No chess game ever repeats itself, which look forward to. Every game you are the
                    general of an army and you alone decide the destiny of your soldiers. You can sacrifice them, trade
                    them, pin them, fork them, lose them, defend them, or order them to break through any barriers and
                    surround the enemy king. You've got the power! To summarize everything in
                    three little words: Chess is Everything!
