            <h1>Rules</h1>
            <p>The rules of chess are published by <abbr title="фр. Federation Internationale des Echecs">FIDE</abbr>,
                chess's international governing body, in its Handbook.Rules published by national governing bodies, or
                by unaffiliated chess organizations, commercial publishers, etc., may differ.
                <abbr title="фр. Federation Internationale des Echecs">FIDE's</abbr>
                rules were most recently revised in 2018. Chess pieces are divided into white and black sets. While the
                sets may not be literally white and black (e.g. the light set may be a yellowish or off-white color,
                the dark set may be red), they are always referred to as white and black. Each set consists of 16
                pieces: one king, one queen, two rooks, two bishops, two knights, and eight pawns. The pieces are set
                out as shown in the diagram and photo. The players of the sets are referred to as White and Black,
                respectively. The game is played on a square board of eight rows (called ranks, denoted 1 to 8 from
                bottom to top according to White's perspective) and eight columns (called files, denoted a to h from
                left to right according to White's perspective). The 64 squares alternate in color and are referred to
                as light and dark squares. The chessboard is placed with a light square at the right-hand corner nearest
                to each player. Thus, each queen starts on a square of its own color (the white queen on a light square;
                the black queen on a dark square).
            </p>
            <p>
                In competitive games, the colors are allocated by the organizers; in informal games, the colors are
                usually decided randomly, for example by a coin toss, or by one player concealing a white pawn in one
                hand and a black pawn in the other, and having the opponent choose. White moves first, after which
                players alternate turns, moving one piece per turn (except for castling, when two pieces are moved). A
                piece is moved to either an unoccupied square or one occupied by an opponent's piece, which is captured
                and removed from play. With the sole exception of en passant, all pieces capture by moving to the square
                that the opponent's piece occupies. Moving is compulsory; it is illegal to skip a turn, even when having
                to move is detrimental. A player may not make any move that would put or leave the player's own king in
                check. If the player to move has no legal move, the game is over; the result is either checkmate (a loss
                for the player with no legal move) if the king is in check, or stalemate (a draw) if the king is not.
            </p>
            <ul>Each piece has its own way of moving. In the diagrams, the dots mark the squares to which the piece can
                move if there are no intervening piece(s) of either color (except the knight, which leaps over any
                intervening pieces):
                <li>The king moves one square in any direction. The king also has a special move called castling that
                    involves also moving a rook.</li>
                <li>A rook can move any number of squares along a rank or file, but cannot leap over other pieces. Along
                    with the king, a rook is involved during the king's castling move.</li>
                <li>A bishop can move any number of squares diagonally, but cannot leap over other pieces.</li>
                <li>A queen combines the power of a rook and bishop and can move any number of squares along a rank,
                    file, or diagonal, but cannot leap over other pieces.</li>
                <li>A knight moves to any of the closest squares that are not on the same rank, file, or diagonal. (Thus
                    the move forms an "L"-shape: two squares vertically and one square horizontally, or two squares
                    horizontally and one square vertically.) The knight is the only piece that can leap over other
                    pieces.</li>
                <li>A pawn can move forward to the unoccupied square immediately in front of it on the same file, or on
                    its first move it can advance two squares along the same file, provided both squares are unoccupied
                    (white dots in the diagram); or the pawn can capture an opponent's piece on a square diagonally in
                    front of it on an adjacent file, by moving to that square (black "x"s). A pawn has two special
                    moves: the en passant capture and promotion:</li>

            <h2>Castling</h2>
            <ul>Once in every game, each king can make a special move, known as castling. Castling consists of moving
                the king two squares along the first rank toward a rook on the player's first rank, and then placing the
                rook on the last square that the king crossed. Castling is permissible if the following conditions are
                met:
                <li>Neither the king nor the rook has previously moved during the game.</li>
                <li>There are no pieces between the king and the rook.</li>
                <li>The king is not in check, and will not pass through or land on any square attacked by an enemy
                    piece.
                    (Note that castling is permitted if the rook is under attack, or if the rook crosses an attacked
                    square.)</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>En passant</h2>
            <p>When a pawn makes a two-step advance from its starting position and there is an opponent's pawn on a
                square next to the destination square on an adjacent file, then the opponent's pawn can capture it en
                passant ("in passing"), moving to the square the pawn passed over. This can be done only on the very
                next turn; otherwise, the right to do so is forfeited. For example, in the animated diagram, the black
                pawn advances two steps from g7 to g5, and the white pawn on f5 can take it en passant on g6 (but only
                on White's next move).</p>
            <h2>Promotion</h2>
            <p>When a pawn advances to the eighth rank, as a part of the move it is promoted and must be exchanged for
                the player's choice of queen, rook, bishop, or knight of the same color. Usually, the pawn is chosen to
                be promoted to a queen, but in some cases, another piece is chosen; this is called underpromotion. In
                the animated diagram, the pawn on c7 can be advanced to the eighth rank and be promoted. There is no
                restriction on the piece promoted to, so it is possible to have more pieces of the same type than at the
                start of the game (e.g., two or more queens).</p>

            <h2>Check and checkmate</h2>
            <p>When a king is under immediate attack by one or two of the opponent's pieces, it is said to be in check.
                A move in response to a check is legal only if it results in a position where the king is no longer in
                check. This can involve capturing the checking piece; interposing a piece between the checking piece and
                the king (which is possible only if the attacking piece is a queen, rook, or bishop and there is a
                square between it and the king); or moving the king to a square where it is not under attack. Castling
                is not a permissible response to a check. The object of the game is to checkmate the opponent; this
                occurs when the opponent's king is in check, and there is no legal way to remove it from attack. It is
                never legal for a player to make a move that puts or leaves the player's own king in check. In casual
                games, it is common to announce "check" when putting the opponent's king in check, but this is not
                required by the rules of chess and is not usually done in tournaments.</p>
